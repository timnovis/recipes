# Lazy Roast Potatoes

These potatoes don't require any parboiling. Lovely stuff.

##Â Ingredients

- Maris piper potatoes (does this really matter? who knows)
- Olive oil (a lot)
- Salt (good stuff only)

## Method

- Chop potatoes into 2cm pieces, quarters, chunks, whatever you want to call them.
- Splash a fair amount of olive oil into a roasting tin
- Whack the potatoes in there too
- Sprinkle a bit of good salt over them
- Mix with your hands until covered
- Roast, fan 200 celcius, for somewhere in the region of 40-60 minutes. Just keep your eye on them. Get them out and turn them every so often too, maybe every 15-20 minutes, to prevent sticking and uneven cooking.
